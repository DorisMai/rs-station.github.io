# What is Reciprocal Space Station?
Reciprocal Space Station (RSS) began in [Doeke Hekstra's lab](hekstralab.fas.harvard.edu) with  `reciprocalspaceship`, a crystallographically-aware extension of the popular `pandas` python package.

As `reciprocalspaceship` and other packages expanded and gained contributors outside of the Hekstra Lab, it became clear that it was time for Reciprocal Space Station to "take off" and become a separate organization. Our goal is for RSS to grow as a hub for open-source crystallographic software, gaining both new packages and new astronauts.
